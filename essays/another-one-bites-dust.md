## Brief Overview

As per usual, if you want a TL;DR: here it is!

The WODs, both practice and actual, serve as a good basis to practice and reinforce the skills, syntax, and methodology for programming and software engineering; so that one might efficiently put "pen-to-paper" (or finger-to-keyboard in this case). So with that, I think that my current means of preparation, performing, analyzing, optimizing, and creating similar programs for repetition's sake, is an sufficient means- at least for me- for the purpose of Athletic Software Engineering.
  
## The First of Many

As in my TL;DR my preparation was straightforward and predictable: like a Japanese cram school student who overslept the day of the big test. If you have already forgotten over the past fourty-something words, then I am here to kindly remind you (now in greater detail) the steps I took:

**1)** Performing:
Peforming, in this case, means that I simply go in blind and run at it head-on to guage my skills. After the first attempt, if I DNF then I refer to the solution put forth by the professor and go to the next step. If not: then I simply go at it again and attack it from another angle. This step can usually repeat, but I have not usually performed blind for more than three attempts.

**2)** Analyzing:
Analyzing is straight forward: look at my solution(s) and compare it to the professor's code and ask myself some questions:

"*Is the means of handling my data efficient?*"

"*Are there more quick and straightforward ways of tackling the problem?*"

"*Out of all of these solutions which ones were done with the least lines and keystrokes?*"

"*How close did I get to matching the professor's code?*"
"*How is it different?*"
"*How is it the same?*"

"*Is my code digestable? Easy to read?*"

These questions and their answers will be used in my next step:

**3)** Optimizing:
This step is self-explanatory (you should be ashamed if you don't know your vocabulary). This step entails that I simply apply the answers to the code: simple, right?

**4)** Repeating:
This step is also pretty simple: it's the first step all over again... But with greater insight! The goal is to ingrain the methodologies, techniques, and syntax so that it's a muscle memory skill. 

However, I have found that this slightly backfires in the long run as I learn more skills: as syntax varies from language-to-language, so I have found myself being less anal about these things.

## Farming and Leveling Up

So the first WOD? It wasn't anything too hard with the experience and practice I put in. However, that is not to say the WODs will be easy- or even this one was. To put it down quickly and fulfill the requirements within the constraints is difficult to do under pressure unless you have practice. So, the experience from the WODs are valuable as they train students in a self-imposed constraint: all for the purpose of tapping into training methods untouched until then. 

Therefore, I will continue to do as I have done: taking this experience and using it as motivation to go on and improve even further!

## Reflections upon the Yellow River

Taking into the account the self-imposed restraint of using recursion to avoid using loops, as suggested by the professor, I think this is the only way I could have fulfilled the WOD's conditions. However, I think that I was sloppy and/or too pressed to properly break the recursion loop. I also could have allowed the function to be more dynamic rather than purposely breaking at 100 (i.e. allowing the function to accept to integers of min and max).

I'm not good at reflecting when nobody has proposed no other way to do it within that no-loop constraint.

## I ***HATE*** Discussion Posts!

Discussing WODs after they're finished is what I do in preparation, so my answer to the question of "Is there value in discussion?" is obvious:

***YES!***

Sharing ideas and getting feedback is a good way to not develop bad habits and have a wider range of view. Discussion as a whole doesn't allow anybody to become complacent: because there's no such thing as something that's perfect for everybody. 

So with that, this little discussion disguised as an essay is finished, and I hope that anybody reading this takes the time to polish up some skills underneath a timer. Who knows? Maybe you'll learn something.
