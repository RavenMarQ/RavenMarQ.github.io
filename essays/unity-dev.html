  <h2 id="brief-overview">Brief Overview</h2>

<p>As per usual, if you want a TL;DR: here it is!</p>

<p>Learning Unity both from just a visual experience to a VR-interaction-based game, forced me to learn C# and a whole lot of other engine-specific things.</p>

<h2 id="what-even-is-unity-world-peace">What even is Unity? World Peace?</h2>

<p>The Unity engine is a development platform for making just about any experience you want: 3D, 2D, games, experiences, apps, etc. The Unity engine supports building to PC, mobile, console, and extended reality. So in essence: the world is mine to explore learning this engine.</p>

<p>The Unity engine also runs off of C#, and any code written for it must also be in C#. The code written for your projects, also known as scripts, interact with the engine’s built in environment of GameObjects. GameObjects initially only have a Transform that describes their position, rotation, and scale. However, GameComponents can have components that are essentially give life to these transforms: renderers to give it a look or shape, physics engine properties, behavior scripts, etc. This doesn’t even include the particle and effect systems that are built-in or make yourself.</p>

<p>As a development platform, Unity is famous for so many games and other things that the recent controversy surrounding the platform comes as no surprise: as the community has relied on its shoulders for the longest time.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-did-i-even-learn">So what did I even learn?</h2>

<p>The first <strong><em>successful</em></strong> project in Unity I did was with a group: to develop an experience for an indoor real life space. The indoor space provided was the <a href="https://www.lavaflow.info/createx">CreateX</a> lab under the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization &amp; Applications (LAVA).</p>

  <p>Here are the two links to learn more about LAVA:</p>

<p><em>An example of the displays at CreateX</em></p>

<p>If you want to see the experience that we created as a group, you can see a demo video and the unity package <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nvHqXi_w_vDd5SDY8YxfFI7qFILqMb_-">here</a>.</p>

<p>Through that, I got the true basics of dealing with GameObjects and basic scripts by creating an environment and adding moving parts. This, in turn, was a good way to see the artistic potential and the low barrier to entry that Unity is. As a team, Unity is perfect as a ground to practice issue based project management, as everyone can instantly see what is going on just by pressing the “run” button.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Oh why is that glitching through?”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Or</strong></p>

  <p><em>“Oh. That is not rendering.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You put into practice a lot of the problem-solving and project-management skills when making something. And I learned that the hard way when I went in blind in middle school to make a game, but absolutely didn’t know how to code in C# or how to properly solve a problem. And, unsurprisingly, I gave up. So revisiting Unity with more experience was a fun time.</p>

<p>For my second Unity project, which you can see a more in-depth explanation about it <a href="https://ravenmarq.github.io/projects/tank-command.html">here</a>, I learned more about Component system and the true power of scripts. Here, on my blank canvas, I was given power to create whatever I could think of as long as I had the skill and drive to do so.</p>

<p>Taking the knowledge from all the ICS courses I had taken in my career as an aspiring programmer, I managed to create a demo of my first solo project. I am so happy with this basic demo, that I even plan to build atop it and make a more fleshed-out game (and I hope that I can one day update my projects tab to include it).</p>

<p>From virtual reality, physics engines, and frame updates, the manual and AI assistance were vital in holding my hand throughout the way. In time, I found myself I was learning the specifics of the C# language, the enums and functions of the Unity engine, and the quirks of the platform, I found myself working more and more efficiently than when I first started. Over the course of a semester, I went from not knowing C# and Unity to being confident enough to make a solo project.</p>

<p>So for what’s next, keep an eye out for me! Hell, maybe I make the next best-selling game!</p>
